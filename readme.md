## Overview

<!-- TODO: To be changed -->
<!-- The following are just sample -->
This project focuses on designing templates for product features. The goal is to learn how to create unique templates for these features.

My website is straightforward, with minimal flashy animations. It primarily involves scrolling through various layouts. Despite its simplicity, the website emphasizes a clean and unique design.

The technologies that I used were HTML and CSS. I used HTML for the contents and structure of the website and CSS to design the contents in order for it to look good.


### Key Components
<!-- TODO: List of Key Components -->

## Rules, Practices and Principles
1. Always use `WD-` in the front of the Title of the Project for the Subject followed by your custom naming.
2. Do not rename any .html files; always use `index.html` as the filename.
3. Place Files in their respective folders.
4. All file naming are in camel case.
   - Camel case is naming format where there is no white space in separation of each words, the first word is in all lower case while the succeding words first letter are in upper followed by lower cased letters.
   - ex.: buttonAnimatedStyle.css
5. Use only `External CSS`.
6. Renaming of Pages folder names are a must, and relates to what it is doing or data it holding.
7. File Structure to follow below.

```

|   └─ css
|   |   └─ style.css
|   └─ img
|   |   └─ fileWith.jpeg/.jpg/.webp/.png
